# Agent Script Reference: Conditional Expressions

`if` and `else` conditions deterministically specify what actions to take or which prompts to include. For example, you can check a variable's value and then run an action based on the result:

**Example: Conditionally Run an Action**

```agentscript
if @variables.tracking_number != "":
    run @actions.Get_Tracking_Updates
else:
    run @actions.Ask_Tracking_Number
```

You can also check a variable in order to set other variables.

**Example: Conditionally Set a Variable**

```agentscript
if @variables.order_number == "" and @variables.customer_email == "":
    set @variables.order_found = False
    set @variables.customer_verified = False
```

You can use a conditional expression to determine which natural-language prompt to include.

**Example: Conditionally Add a Prompt**

```agentscript
if @variables.is_late == True:
    | Apologize to the customer for the delay in receiving their order.
else:
    | Tell the customer their order is arriving as scheduled.
```

> **Note**
>
> Currently, Agent Script supports `if` and `else` logic, but it doesn't support `else if` logic after an `if` statement.
